AJAX Like/Dislike (ALD)

An unobtrusive rating module for Lepton CMS and WebsiteBaker (untested).

The module's JavaScript is based on the work by Masuga Design,
http://www.masugadesign.com/software/unobtrusive-ajax-star-rating-bar/

Therefore, while this module itself is GPL software, parts of it are under different
licenses.

Features and Benefits
---------------------

AJAX Like/Dislike is the first like/dislike module for Lepton CMS and WebsiteBaker.
It was created as an offspin from the AJAX Star Rating module for people who want
this kind of rating but keep the results safely stored in their own database.

With JavaScript turned on in the user's web browser, ALD does the real AJAX thing
so if for instance you use this module to rate a video or audio file, playback won't
stop when rating is triggered.
On the other hand ALD still functions flawlessly with JavaScript turned off, although
in this case a page reload can't be avoided.

In case you don't like negative feedback you can turn ALD into 'like only' mode, so
just a Like button is displayed. This setting will be stored in your database and
can't be changed afterwards, except you edit your db directly.

A very handy feature is to mark a rating as private so only members of your site
are able to vote, even if the page that contains the rating is public. Private is
off by default

You can add ratings or even turn existing ones into 'static' state which disables
voting for everyone. Static is off by default.

ALD's default layout can easily be customizesd through CSS, even the images used.

The voters' IP addresses are stored to prevent the same person from voting again
instantly. However, after a default timeout of 6 hrs the IP number will be deleted.
This is done because most people, at least in Europe, don't have permanent IP
addresses and storing these numbers forever would some day prevent random users from
voting, which might lead to a frustrating experience.
Also there are strict privacy laws in most European countries that don't permit
storing IP numbers for more than a few days.
To satisfy those who want to exclude these IPs forever: edit the droplet and set
'$timeout=-1'; this disables deletion for good.

The last important thing: for each rating you have to set a unique ID. This ID
may be up to 25 characters long, supporting just letters from a-z or A-Z (no
umlauts, accents and whatsoever), numbers from 0-9, dash (-) and underscore (_).

Usage
-----

Unlike most modules ALD is no page module - it is a snippet. Despite the different
name AJAX Star Rating can be installed like any other module.

To work properly ALD comes packed with a Droplet which will be installed automatically
in Lepton; if in WebsiteBaker this doesn't work, please follow these steps:
1. Unpack ALD to you harddrive
2. Open \install\ald.php with an editor and copy the entire code
3. In WebsiteBaker backend open the 'Admin Tools' tab and click on 'Droplets'
4. Create a new droplet named 'ald', paste the copied code to it and save


Once you have both parts installed properly, just go and add the droplet to
one of your pages. Possible parameters are:
id = Unique Identifier (up to 25 characters)
 l = like only (no dislike displayed); true/false or 1/0
 s = static (no rating possible); true/false or 1/0
 p = private (logged-in users only); true/false or 1/0

Minimum call: [[ald?id=thisid]]
This adds a like/dislike rating which is neither private, nor static

Full call:    [[ald?id=myid&l=1&s=1&p=1]]
This adds a like-only rating, which is static, and private
